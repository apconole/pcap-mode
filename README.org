* pcap-mode.el

Load an display a pcap file using the =tshark= utility.

To copy it yourself, simply:

#+NAME: setup_pcap_mode
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
 git clone https://github.com/orgcandman/pcap-mode.git
#+END_SRC

* Setup

In your =.emacs= initialization, add the following:

#+NAME: elisp-to-initialize
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/pcap-mode")
(require 'pcap-mode)
#+END_SRC

Then, when you open any .pcap file, the =tshark-executable= will be 
invoked against the filename, and the contents displayed in the buffer.

* Normally working with pcap-mode

When pcap-mode initially completes, it will display a summary-line listing of
the packets.  This is comparable to the tshark output when run against the
pcap file.  Example:

[[https://github.com/orgcandman/pcap-mode/blob/master/extra/pcapmode-core.png][file:extra/pcapmode-core.png]]

The mode map (customizable via =pcap-mode-map= variable) is defaulted as 
follows:

| Key      | Function                             | Description                                                                   |
|----------+--------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <return> | pcap-view-pkt-contents               | Pop up a separate buffer with the contents of a specific packet               |
| f        | pcap-set-tshark-filter               | Change the buffer local display filter applied to the pcap file.              |
| q        | anonymous call to kill-buffer        | Destroys the pcap buffer and all open packet buffers.                         |
| r        | pcap-reload-file                     | Reload the current pcap buffer.                                               |
| s        | pcap-set-tshark-single-packet-filter | Same as 'C-u f' keybind.                                                      |
| t        | pcap-list-tcp-conversations          | Sets the tshark options to follow tcp streams.                                |
| C-u f    | pcap-set-tshark-single-packet-filter | Change the command line settings passed when running against a single packet. |
| C-c C-d  | anonymous debug function             | Display some debugging information                                            |

The filters are "smart" and will remember previous values set, making 
switching between filters convenient.

The packet viewer is a call to =tshark-executable= passing 
the =tshark-single-packet-filter= variable as well as the text 
*frame.number==%d* where %d is replaced with the packet number.

Example:

* Hooks and variables

The following hooks are exposed by pcap-mode:

| hook variable       | Hook entry notes                                |
|---------------------+-------------------------------------------------|
| pcap-mode-hook      | Hook run when pcap-mode starts                  |
| pcap-mode-quit-hook | Hook run when pcap-mode window is closed.       |
| pcap-reloaded-hook  | Hook run when the main pcap windows is reloaded |


The following customizable variables exist
| Variable Name                   | Description                                                  |
|---------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------|
| tshark-executable               | Path to the tshark binary                                    |
| reload-pcap-when-filter-changes | Automatically reload pcap window buffer when changing filter |
| tshark-filter                   | Filter used when reloading the pcap viewer window            |
| tshark-single-packet-filter     | Filter used for single-packet viewing                        |
| pcap-mode-map                   | Keymap for pcap-mode                                         |

* TODOS

The following list of todos should be eliminated as they are completed.

** Syntax table to make the list view pretty

** Unit tests? Maybe?

** display filter building wizard
